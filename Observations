From my observations of the upper bound and lower bound of the drugs, it seems like Capomulin and Ramicane are the two more effective drugs on reducing the tumor volume because the upper and lower bound of the respective tumors' volume are noticeably lower than the other drugs.
Interestingly enough, the box plot of the tumor volume by drugs illustrated that the outlier volume for the drug Infubinol seems to be very close to the median value for tumor volumes of the drug Ramicane.
Capomulin and Ramicane are the two most tested drugs on the mice in this experiment, and they are also the two more effective treatments in this experiment.
